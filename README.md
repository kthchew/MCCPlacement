# MCCPlacement
An iOS and macOS app that predicts the placements of various teams in the Minecraft Championships tournament using Apple's [CoreML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml).

This app is just a small personal project for me to practice with Apple's machine learning framework.

## Credits
The data used to create the model was manually put into Excel spreadsheets by me and my friends. Most of the data originates from past tournaments documented on the [MCChampionship Wiki](https://mcchampionship.fandom.com/wiki/MCChampionship_Wiki). Apple's [Create ML](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/create-ml/) was used to create the model.
